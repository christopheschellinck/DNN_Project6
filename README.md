# DNN_Project6

**description:** 
This project is about mole detection making use of a convolutional neural network(category of AI/Deep Learning). It is by making use of images of skin spots that our model is trained and predictions are made. We had to present it afterwards to fellow trainees from the Bouman Becode bootcamp.
We made use of the pretrained mobilenet model and we improved its performance by optimizing its results via data augmentation. The model was also deployed on the Internet by making use of Docker and Heroku.

**Participants:** Christophe Schellinck (team leader), Didier Ukanda, Ankita Haldia and Saba Yahyaa
